## Generative AI Voting: Fair Collective Choice is Resilient to LLM Biases and Inconsistencies

This repository contains the implementation and findings of the study on scaling up deliberative and voting participation using generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs). The research explores how AI personal assistants can enhance direct democracy by overcoming human cognitive limitations, offering decision support, and potentially representing human voters at large scales. It also addresses the risks and biases associated with delegating collective decision-making to LLMs.
